## Introduction
Do you have an excel file with header labeled, otherwise numerical data?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|01|01|09|12|
|01|02|11|14|
|--|--|--|--|
|10|21|18|19|

Would you like to predict **ANY**âœ¨ column value with an AI neural network model?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|12|08|?|08|

This application provides an accessible, easy to understand and click-through interface to make that happen.

> If you'd like to tinker around with some advanced Neural Network model

You can!

> Want to keep track of the built model parameters?

The sidebar display all selected, all built attributes.

> Would you like to download the created model for later use?

No problem. Model files can be downloaded in .pt format.

## Features

- The neural network model offers selectable activation method, optimizer selection, hidden layer and train loop count (epoch) choice, on numerical data inputs from a xlsx file format
- Uses [streamlit][streamlitgui] GUI for frontend
- By default uses a simple, pre-set configuration of Leaky ReLU activation function, 3 hidden layers and 100 epochs to train, thich can be fine-tuned further with 'Advanced Options'
- Model evaulation is based on trained (70%) data, with model predicted values (30%_pred) against real test values (30%_true) 
- Model -on data set load- automatically derives the <row1> labels, on which the user can range specify the N:1 relation of input (x1, x2, x3..) and output value (y1)
- Model parameter selection is fixed for session, until data set changed or page is re-loaded
- Training establishes correlation between input values and with activation and weights shifted and feeds forward towards precision metrics displayed at the end of training
- Metrics are displayed as visualized graph of predicted test data against true test data values
## How to use
1. Prepare an excel (xlsx) file with <row1> labels and <row2,3,...> with only numerical values
2. Upload data via the GUI sidebar - upload button
3. Model will automatically analyze excel file and display header labels
4. Select the output from the list (y1) [all other labels will be taken as x1, x2, x3..]
5. OPTIONAL: Select 'Advanced Options' to fine-tune mode parameters
6. Train model
7. Examine precision metrics
8. Specify new input value and predict a new output value
9. OPTIONAL: Download model .pt file

## Installation

numlp uses several python packages and based on [numpy][numpyver] v1.26.4.
Additional packages are included in the requirements.txt

For local run git clone and step into the cloned repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/th3pajay/numlp
cd numlp
```

Start application:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
or alternatively:
```sh
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
Local GUI now accessible on localhost:8501
