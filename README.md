## Introduction
Do you have an excel file with labeled, numerical data?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|01|01|09|12|
|01|02|11|14|
|--|--|--|--|
|10|21|18|19|

Would you like to predict **ANY**âœ¨ column value with an AI neural network model?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|12|08|?|08|

This application provides an accessible, easy to understand and click-through interface to make that happen.

> If you'd like to tinker around with some advanced Neural Network model
> attributes, such as epochs or hidden layers, increased precision..

You can!

> Want to keep track of the model built?

The sidebar will note and display the running model parameters.

> Would you like to download the created model for later use?

No problem.

## Features

- The neural network model offers selectable activation, hidden layer and train loop count (epoch) on numerical data inputs from xlsx file format
- User interaction via [streamlit][streamlitgui] GUI
- By default uses ReLU activation function, 3 hidden layers and 100 epochs to train and make a baseline comparison on trained (70%), with test data (30%_true) against predicted test data (30%_pred)
- Model -on data set load- automatically derives the <row1> labels, on which the user can range specify the N:1 relation of input (x1, x2, x3..) and output value (y1)
- Model parameter selection is fixed for session, until data set or page is re-loaded
- Training establishes correlation between input values and with activation and weights shifted feeds forward towards precision metrics at the end of epoch run
- Metrics are displayed along with visualized graph of predicted test data against true test data values
## How to use
1. Prepare an excel (xlsx) file with <row1> labels and <row2,3,...> only numerical values
2. Upload data set via the GUI
3. Determine x values (input) and y value (output)
4. Specify advanced neural network parameters if needed
5. Train model
6. Examine precision metrics
7. Specify new input value and predict a new output value


## Cloud

numlp will be linked to Google Cloud to provide an *out-of-the-box*, free service.

| Service | URL |
| ------ | ------ |
| Google Cloud | [TBD][gcloud] |


## Installation

numlp uses several python packages and [numpy][numpyver] v1.26.4.

For local run git clone and step into the cloned repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/th3pajay/numlp
cd numlp
```

Start application:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
or alternatively:
```sh
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
Will automatically open webpage with default steramlit port: 8501
