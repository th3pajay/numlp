Numerical ML NN Prediction application

Do you have an excel file with labeled numerical data?

MONTH DAY AVGTEMP MAXTEMP
01    01  10      12
02    02  11      13
...
11    12  08      9

Would you like to predict ANY column value based on this?
12    12  ?      12

This application provides an accesible, easy to understand and click-through interface to make that happen.

If you'd like to tinker around with some advanced Neural Network model attributes, such as epoch, hidden layers increased for more precision?
You can!

Want to keep track of the model parameters running?
The sidebar will have you covered.

Would you like to download the created model for later use?
No problem.
