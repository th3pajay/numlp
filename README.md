Numerical ML NN Prediction application

Do you have an excel file with labeled numerical data?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|01|01|09|12|
|01|02|11|14|
|--|--|--|--|
|10|21|18|19|

Would you like to predict **ANY** column value based on this trained input data?
|MONTH|DAY|AVGTEMP|MAXTEMP|
|--|--|--|--|
|12|08|?|08|

This application provides an accessible, easy to understand and click-through interface to make that happen.

> If you'd like to tinker around with some advanced Neural Network model

You can!

> Want to keep track of the model parameters running?

The sidebar will have you covered.

> Would you like to download the created model for later use?

No problem.
